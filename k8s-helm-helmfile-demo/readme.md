# Introduction 

In this demo we will start with multi tear web app, and see how we can deploy them to Kubernetes 

- Using just YAML/Manfiests 
- Converting them to individual Helm charts 
- Creating multiple values file to support different deployment requirement 
- Running same set of Helm charts using Helmfile 
- Utilizing Helmfile to support different deployment requirements 

# Sample app

Sample deployment files that we will use in this demo come from Repo [https://github.com/dockersamples/example-voting-app](https://github.com/dockersamples/example-voting-app) - thanks a bunch to [Bret Fisher](https://github.com/BretFisher)

# Pre-req 

We expect you have running kubernetes and have kubectl configured and pointing to correct context so that it can connect to that cluster.
You will also need Helm and helmfile tool installed ( steps for helmfile install are given ) 


# Playground.

If you don't have access to running kubernetes and want to follow this example then you can use online playground provided by [killercoda](https://killercoda.com/kubecon) 
This playground has two nodes ( 2 GB / 2 CPU ) - latest version kubernetes cluster ready to go. It also has helm installed nad browser-based VSCode to edit your yaml/code.the 

# Deploying using yaml/manifest files 

Clone my github repo :

`git clone https://github.com/ishswar/example-voting-app.git`

These has all the code we will use during this demo 

Change into to directory k8s-specifications `cd example-voting-app/k8s-specifications/`
These have YAML files to deploy 

1. Voting app - web app once vote received (via browser) - they are saved into Redis
1. Redis server
1. .NET code that scans Redis server and inserts votes into Database 
1. Database to store Votesthe  
1. Result app that shows votes via reading Database 

There are five apps above - which means we should have 5 Kubernetes deployment files - that is what you will find in `k8s-specifications` 
Now we also need a stable end-point to access apps above. 
The votting app and result app are exposed outside the cluster via NodePort and DB and Redis are exposed internally using ClusterIP.

```
|-- db-deployment.yaml
|-- db-service.yaml
|-- redis-deployment.yaml
|-- redis-service.yaml
|-- result-deployment.yaml
|-- result-service.yaml
|-- vote-deployment.yaml
|-- vote-service.yaml
`-- worker-deployment.yaml
```

## Deploy them 

We can deploy all of them in one shot using command (assuming you are in that directory ) 

`kubectl create -f .` 

output should look like 

```
controlplane $ kubectl create -f .
deployment.apps/db created
service/db created
deployment.apps/redis created
service/redis created
deployment.apps/result created
service/result created
deployment.apps/vote created
service/vote created
deployment.apps/worker created
```

Ideally, we should deploy DB and Redis first , then .NET app and last voting  app and result app - but above command does not guarantee that

After few seconds you should see all pods and service up and running..

Everything gets deployed in `default` namespace.

```
controlplane $ kubectl get pods && kubectl get svc
NAME                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
db-989b6b476-jqw6r       1/1     Running   0          2m28s
redis-7fdbb9576f-2vqvq   1/1     Running   0          2m28s
result-f9f4fbbc7-kzz6d   1/1     Running   0          2m28s
vote-5f865477fc-fb629    1/1     Running   0          2m28s
worker-667975666-8lbkr   1/1     Running   0          2m28s
NAME         TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
db           ClusterIP   10.97.51.10      <none>        5432/TCP         2m28s
kubernetes   ClusterIP   10.96.0.1        <none>        443/TCP          26d
redis        ClusterIP   10.104.196.148   <none>        6379/TCP         2m28s
result       NodePort    10.97.138.2      <none>        5001:31001/TCP   2m28s
vote         NodePort    10.96.230.143    <none>        5000:31000/TCP   2m28s
```

You should be able to access voting GUI via URL like http://(node-ip):31000 - it will look like this :

Submit your vote and now you can access result page via URL like: http://(node-ip):31001 - it might look like this :

This concludes our steps of deploying multi-tier applications on kubernetes using YAML files.  

## Tear it down 

Before proceeding to next step lets cleanup so we can start fresh - delete all objects using same YAML that we used before 
Make sure you are in directory `example-voting-app/k8s-specifications/` 

`kubectl delete -f .` 

This will delete all deployments and services. ÃŸ

# Deploy using Helm 

Next step we can deploy same application as above but this time using helm charts. 
We will create 5 charts - one for each of application. 

General steps : 

1. Create a Helm chart using `helm create` command
1. Delete YAML files created by above command 
1. Move our original Helm files for each application under `templates` subfolder 
1. Use `helm install` to install chart 

You have two choices - create charts manually (follow below steps) or check-out branch using command `git checkout with-helm` this will get you same charts that you will have if you follow below steps.

## Creates Charts 

```
helm create db  
helm create vote.
helm create redis
helm create worker
helm create result
```

## Delete all autogenerated YAMLs 
```
rm -rf */templates/*.yaml
rm -rf */templates/*.txt
rm -rf */templates/tests
```
List no YAML is there in sub folder `templates` 
```
ls -la */templates/*
```

## Move existing YAML for each application to it's individual Helm chart 
```
mv db-*.yaml db/templates/
mv vote-*.yaml vote/templates/
mv redis-*.yaml redis/templates/
mv worker-*.yaml worker/templates/
mv result*.yaml result/templates/
```

At the end, if you run command `ls -la */templates/*,` the output should look like below   
Make sure you are in the directory `example-voting-app/k8s-specifications`

```
controlplane $ ls -la */templates/*
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1732 Feb 22 04:08 db/templates/_helpers.tpl
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  634 Feb 22 04:07 db/templates/db-deployment.yaml
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  191 Feb 22 04:07 db/templates/db-service.yaml
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1762 Feb 22 04:08 redis/templates/_helpers.tpl
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  492 Feb 22 04:07 redis/templates/redis-deployment.yaml
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  203 Feb 22 04:07 redis/templates/redis-service.yaml
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1772 Feb 22 04:08 result/templates/_helpers.tpl
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  383 Feb 22 04:07 result/templates/result-deployment.yaml
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  221 Feb 22 04:07 result/templates/result-service.yaml
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1752 Feb 22 04:08 vote/templates/_helpers.tpl
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  369 Feb 22 04:07 vote/templates/vote-deployment.yaml
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  216 Feb 22 04:07 vote/templates/vote-service.yaml
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1772 Feb 22 04:08 worker/templates/_helpers.tpl
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  317 Feb 22 04:07 worker/templates/worker-deployment.yaml
```


## Install using Helm charts 

``` 
helm install db ./db 
helm install redis ./redis
helm install worker ./worker
helm install result ./result
helm install vote ./vote
```

### List all charts 

```
controlplane $ helm list
NAME    NAMESPACE       REVISION        UPDATED                                 STATUS          CHART           APP VERSION
db      default         1               2023-02-22 04:10:32.109280565 +0000 UTC deployed        db-0.1.0        1.16.0     
redis   default         1               2023-02-22 04:10:34.518627295 +0000 UTC deployed        redis-0.1.0     1.16.0     
result  default         1               2023-02-22 04:10:36.716386874 +0000 UTC deployed        result-0.1.0    1.16.0     
vote    default         1               2023-02-22 04:10:38.735587035 +0000 UTC deployed        vote-0.1.0      1.16.0     
worker  default         1               2023-02-22 04:10:35.724799692 +0000 UTC deployed        worker-0.1.0    1.16.0  
```

The above shows all 5 charts are installed.   
Now you can try to access the same URLs as before to access the ***Voting*** application and ***Result*** application 

This concludes our demo about how you can deploy 
 

`git checkout with-helm-values`

`helm template vote ./vote -f ./vote/values.yaml`

`helm template vote ./vote -f ./vote/values-dev.yaml`

`helm template vote ./vote -f ./vote/values-dev.yaml --set service.nodeport=31006`

```
wget https://github.com/helmfile/helmfile/releases/download/v0.151.0/helmfile_0.151.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz
tar -xvf helmfile_0.151.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz 
mv helmfile /usr/sbin/
cd /root/example-voting-app/k8s-specifications
helmfile template  --set service.nodeport=31006 | grep -A10 -B15 31006
